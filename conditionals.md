### Exercise
Situation: People can apply for financial benefits from the government.
The policy is to grant every government employee benefits for only 2 of his children, 1.000â‚¬ for each child if he/she is less than or equal to 20 years old.
Write code using the conditional statements (if, else, elif) that checks the following conditions:
- If the person's occupation is "government employee", check if they have kids eligible for benefits, and if yes, calculate the total benefit amount, and print the message "Total benefit: " and total benefit amount
- If the person's occupation is an entrepreneur, print the message "You make sure you pay your tax!"
If the person has any other occupation, output the message "This policy is only for government employees!"

Test your code by creating a variable like this: 
`person_occupation = "government employee"`
and change the occupation you assign to test every scenario.

#### Bonus:
Let's do the above exercise using an input() function this time. Assign a variable called occupation using the input() function, using a description to print, like "What is your occupation?". Similarly assign a variable number_of_children by asking a question (like "Give number of children") to the user using the input() function. For each child, ask the age of the child to the user similarly using the input() function and calculate the total benefit amount.

### Exercise
Situation: A transport company charges the fare according to following table:

| Distance |  Charges |
|----------|----------|
| 1-50     | 12 $/Km  |
| 51-100   | 10 $/Km  |
| 100      |  8 $/Km  |

1. Create a distance variable and assign it to 37 
2. Compute the total fare for your variable using if, else, elif statements.
3. Output "Total fare is <total fare> for <distance> km "
4. Change your distance variable and compute the total fare for the following total distances as well:
  - 68km
  - 1700km
