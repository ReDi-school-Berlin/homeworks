### Exercise
Have you watched Mary Poppins? I haven't but there is a loooooong word that became popular from that movie.
Let's do a bit of coding using the "for" loop
Assign this loooooong word "supercalifragilisticexpialidocious" to a string variable
For each letter in this looooooong word
- print it
- Count the number of letters
- Print the number of letters at the end

### Exercise
Imagine that you have a bicycle that has a flat tyre and you are trying to pump it up with code. Its inflation percentage is currently 20.
Write a few lines of code that will do the following until the inflation percentage <100:
- print "PUMPING TYRE"
- Each time you pump the tyre, you add 10 to the inflation percentage
- print "Tyre inflation percentage " and the new inflation percentage after you pumped some air
- At the end, print "FINISHED"

### Exercise

`fruits = ["banana", "apple", "cherry"]`

For each fruit in the fruits list, display "It's a {fruit}" on the screen.

### Exercise
Print every integer number until 10 starting from 1 using a for loop and the `range()` function

Then, using the same loop above, stop printing when it's 5

### Exercise

Print the following pattern to the screen:
```
*
* *
* * *
* * * *
* * * * *
```
_hint: use nested loops_

### Exercise
Print characters placed at even index numbers from a given string of users choice

For example: 
word = REDI
Then it would print out:
index 0 = R
index 2 = D
_hint: use for loop and play with the step size of the range_

### Exercise
How many times does the letter 'b' appear in the string below?

sentence = "Betty bought butter but the butter was bitter so Betty bought another butter to make the bitter butter better"

### Exercise
Write a for loop so that every item in the list is printed

`animals = ["koala", "cat", "fox", "panda", "chipmunk", "sloth", "penguin", "dolphin"]`

### Exercise
Write a for loop which prints "Hello!, " plus each name in the list. i.e.: "Hello!, Sam"
`names = ["Sam", "Lisa", "Micha", "Dave", "Wyatt", "Emma", "Sage"]`

### Exercise
Write a for loop which appends the square of each number to a new list (you have to create this new list).
`numbers = [3, 7, 6, 8, 9, 11, 15, 25]`

### Exercise
Write a for loop using an if statement, that appends each number to a new list if it's positive.
`all_numbers = [111, 32, -9, -45, -17, 9, 85, -10]`

### Exercise
Calculate the sum of all numbers from 1 to a given number 
The number given should be given by the user _hint: use input()_

### Exercise:
Write a program to print multiplication table of a given number (again via user input)

for example if num = 2
the output should be:
```
2
4
6
8
10
12
14
16
18
20
```

### Exercise
Write a program to count the total number of digits in a number using a loop.

For example, the number is 75869, so the output should be 5.

### Exercise
Print the items of the given list in reverse
`reverse_this_list = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]`

### Exercise
Write a program to use a loop to find the factorial of a given number. The number should be given by user input.
_The factorial (symbol: !) means to multiply all whole numbers from the chosen number down to 1._

For example: calculate the factorial of 5: 
5! = 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 120
Expected output for 5: 120


### Exercise
Reverse a given integer number. The number should be given by user input
Example: 76542 should output 24567

### Exercise
Given the following scores, write a program that prints each score.
`scores = [5, 6, 6, 13, 6, 16, 2, 4, 6, 15, 3, 7, 20, 3, 24, 24, 1, 23, 3, 3, 3, 21, 7, 2, 12]`

- What is the length of the list?
- Given the same list of scores, write a program that count how many 3s there is
- given the same list of scores, find the maximum in the list

### Exercise
Given this two lists, write a program which prints the common elements
`list_1 = ["foo", 2, "bar", 3, "baz", "spam", 4]`
`list_2 = ["1", 2, "3", 3, "4", "foo", "pasm", "bar"]`

### Exercise
Given the following dictionary, print all the key value pairs
```
track = {
  "name": "Cold Heart - PNAU Remix",
  "album": "The Lockdown Session",
  "artist": "Elton John",
  "plays": 718593537,
  "duration": 202
}
```

- Create one (or more) track(s) of your choice with the same format
- Put them in a tracks list (playlist)
- Compute the playlist total length (sum of durations)


### Exercise
Given the following dictionary of scores, print the grades of the student.
```
scores = {"Jane": 19, "John": 11, "Jany": 16, "Johny": 13, "Janet": 14, "Jean": 12 }
```
Rules:
- Grade = A when score >= 16
- Grade = B when 14 >= score < 16
- Grade = C when 12 >= score < 14
- Grade = D when score < 12
