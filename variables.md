### Exercise
Create 3 variables:
- Your favourite food
- Your hobby
- The current day
Then print out a string that says something like:
"Thursday was a good day, I ate pizza and played guitar" _(hint: use the + operator)_

### Exercise
Let's do some math! Print the results of the following operations:
- 59876 multiplied by 4359
- 88659 divided by 5498
- the remainder when you divide 867 by 23
- 5 raised to the power of 89 _(yes, Python can work with very large numbers!:))_

For each operation of the previous exercise, what is the type of the result?

### Exercise
Create a variable to store the value of pi and use it to print the following sentence:
"The value of pi is 3.14" 
_(hint: joining floats and strings is not as simple as two strings, but you could google it, for example "how to join a float and a string in python")_

### Exercise
- assign any string to a variable named x
- assign any integer value to a variable named y
- create another variable named z with an integer value and display the sum of y and z

 
### Exercise

Given three variables:
pi = 3.14
pi_pi = '3.14'
pi_pi_pi = "3.14"

Are pi and pi_pi equal? if not why?
Are pi_pi and pi_pi_pi equal? if not why?

### Exercise
Using these following variables:
age = 26
first_name = "Ada"
last_name = "Lovelace"
Print the following sentence:
`"Ada Lovelace was 26 when she wrote the first computer program"`
