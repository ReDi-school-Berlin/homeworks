### Exercise
Write a function to check if a number is in a given range. 
_(Hint: you need 3 parameters, 2 for defining the range, 1 for the number you want to check.)_
Example: Given the range 4 to 10, check if 5 is included. The expected result is True. You could also return a phrase like, “The number 5 is included in the range”

### Exercise
Create a function that will help us what to take with us by giving the weather. (So the function has a parameter called weather.) Examples:

- If it’s sunny, your function will return “Take sunglasses”
- If it’s raining, your function will return “Take umbrella”
- If it’s snowing, your function will return “Take your gloves”
- If it’s cold, your function will return “Take your jacket”
- Add an option for when you don’t have the weather in your examples, something like, "Try again".
- Can you think about more conditions? Get creative!

### Exercise
Create a function that produces a random integer integer between (0,100) and asks for user to guess the number.
- If the user guessed the number correctly, it prints "That's right! You guessed it! Congrats" 
- If the user could not guess it right, it prints "I'm sorry, but that's not correct."


### Exercie

Use a built-in function to print a random number between 1-10

### Exercise 

Write a python program to check whether a given integer is a multiple of 5 or not
_hint: Use the %(modulo operator) and if else statements_

### Exercise

Create a function that asks the user to input two numbers and checks which one of the two is the largest. 

For example: 24 and 45---> 45 is the larger number
_hint: Use if else statements and 'input' to get values from the user._

### Exercise
Write a program that asks the user input for a string and then creates a character counter dictionary which holds the number of characters for each character. 
Print this dictionary at the end. 

For example if input is `"redi is the best"`, the output should be (the order of the characters in the output dict doesn't matter):
```
{
    'e': 3,
    'i': 2,
    's': 2,
    't': 2,
    'r': 1,
    'd': 1,
    'h': 1,
    'b': 1,
    ' ': 3,
}
```

### Exercise
By using Google, find a funciton that gives you current date and time and print the current date and time

### Exercise
Function in another function
1. Create a simple function with two parameters that returns their sum.
2. Call the function and save the result into a variable (name of the variable is up to you).
3. Create andother function with one parameter that decides if the parameter is divided by 3 and prints appropriate messages
4. Call the second function and use the variable that you created in the 2. part as argument.
